# vm-dev
A Virtual Machine for fullstack development.

TIP: This Vagrant configuration comes with a set of Open Source predefined tools for a typical fullstack stack including Java/Spring on the backend side and ECMAScript on the frontend side.

Includes:

- VCS: git
- Integration : Docker CE, K3S (Kubernetes), k9s
- Testing tools : Bruno
- Performance tools: JVisualVM, MAT, JMeter
- Database tools : DBeaver, Pgbadger
- VM : Guest addons


## Prerequisites

### To build a virtual box VM
* https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install?product_intent=vagrant[Install] a recent vagrant distribution.

### To run the VM

* A Linux / Windows/ Mac OS machine with 16 GB+ RAM (for actual fullstack autonomous development, target 32 GiB+)
* A recent (7+) https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[Virtualbox installation] with associated extension pack. Note that you don't have to install VirtualBox guest additions into the VM, it is already done in the Vagrant image.


TIP: Prefer light hosts and stop a maximum of host programs to save memory for your VM. I prefer a XFCE-based Debian host.

TIP: For corporate development and especially if the VM is not stored on an encrypted disk (like a FDE disk), we strongly recommend to encrypt the virtual disks.

## How to build an image ?

* Search  for `[CUSTOM]` comments, they indicate good place to customize the VM.
* This image is primary preset for a french-bases locale, you can change this in the Vagrant file.

## Customization by the end user of the image

* Customize and launch as `vagrant` the `post-install-as-user.sh` script.
* Change the `vagrant` password.

## Troubleshooting

TIP: Check performances logs in `/var/log/atop`
